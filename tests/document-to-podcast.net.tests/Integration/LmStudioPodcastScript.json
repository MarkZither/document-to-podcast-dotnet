We recommend investing in interactive Cyber Security Training labs. We'll reap considerable cost savings by addressing our recruitment challenges, reducing new hire ramp time, increasing employee productivity, improving employee retention, reducing our effort for maintaining in-house training labs and decreasing our reliance on consultants.\",\n  \"Speaker 2\": \"Hi! I'm excited to hear about this. Can you explain it in more detail?\"\n  \"Speaker 1\": \"Sure! Imagine it like this: currently, our team isn't performing at its peak capacity due to missing knowledge. We struggle to recruit Cyber Security employees because of an overheated job market. It takes senior employees considerable time to ramp new hires into productive employees. Our Cyber Security team learns from live incidents instead of realistic training labs. Employees have limited access to static and out-of-date training materials.\",\n  \"Speaker 2\": \"Oh, that's cool! But how does investing in interactive Cyber Security Training labs help us save costs?\"\n  \"Speaker 1\": \"We believe it addresses several problems. First, employees receive a one-size-fits-none training, and senior employees spend significant time building and maintaining proprietary training labs. Our internal Cyber Security training labs are potential attack vectors. We hire external consultants while our team is hungry for knowledge.\",\n  \"Speaker 2\": \"These problems create a gap between our Cyber Security goals and the current situation, right?\"\n  \"Speaker 1\": \"Exactly! That's why we recommend making our Cyber Security team more effective by training them on an air-gapped platform with engaging, interactive, and up-to-date content. We also recommend expanding our talent pool by hiring non-Cyber Security employees and rapidly developing their skills.\"\n  \"Speaker 2\": \"That sounds like it could increase the effectiveness of our team and reduce reliance on internal training labs and external consultants. But how does TryHackMe fit into all this?\"\n}"
